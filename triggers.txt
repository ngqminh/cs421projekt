This trigger raises an error when we try to add tickets that would go over the venue's capacity for one event.

CREATE TRIGGER checkTickets \
BEFORE INSERT on Ticket \
REFERENCING NEW as n \
FOR EACH ROW \
WHEN((SELECT count(*) FROM Ticket t WHERE (n.venue_id = t.venue_id) AND (n.event_id = t.event_id)) >= (SELECT Capacity FROM Venue WHERE (n.venue_id = Venue.venue_id))) \
SIGNAL SQLSTATE '75000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT='Can not have more tickets than capacity'

This trigger prevents two tickets from being in the same seat for the same event.
CREATE TRIGGER checkSeat \
BEFORE INSERT on Ticket \
REFERENCING NEW as n \
FOR EACH ROW \
WHEN((n.venue_id = venue_id) AND (n.seat_id = seat_id)) \
SIGNAL SQLSTATE '75000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT='Can not have a ticket with the same venue and seat'
