CREATE TABLE attendeeXML(email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, Info XML)
	This table is based on the attendee table and contains all the information that it would normally contain such as name and their information stored in XML. 

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email1@at.com', \
'<attendee email = "email1@at.com"> \
 <fname>fname1</fname> \
 <lname>lname1</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone1</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home1</home_address> \
</attendee>')

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email2@at.com', \
'<attendee email = "email2@at.com"> \
 <fname>fname2</fname> \
 <lname>lname2</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone2</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home2</home_address> \
</attendee>')

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email3@at.com', \
'<attendee email = "email3@at.com"> \
 <fname>fname3</fname> \
 <lname>lname3</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone3</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home3</home_address> \
</attendee>')

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email7@ator.com', \
'<attendee email = "email7@ator.com"> \
 <fname>fname7</fname> \
 <lname>lname7</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone7</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home7</home_address> \
</attendee>')

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email8@ator.com', \
'<attendee email = "email8@ator.com"> \
 <fname>fname8</fname> \
 <lname>lname8</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone8</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home8</home_address> \
</attendee>')

INSERT INTO attendeeXML(email, Info) VALUES('email9@ator.com', \
'<attendee email = "email9ator.com"> \
 <fname>fname9</fname> \
 <lname>lname2</lname> \
 <phone_number>phone9</phone_number> \
 <home_address>home9</home_address> \
</attendee>')

The XML data contains attendees with an email attribute. Attendees also have first name, last name, phone number, and home address fields.

Q3) Our database is not changed by using the procedure. The Procedure adds features on top of our database.
This procedure is a raffle where it randomly selects one of our attendees and returns the email for that attendee.

Q4) The program is pretty self-explanatory.

At the beginning, you will be given a menu with numbers. You type in the number then press enter.

*There is a login system. You need to verify your account only once at certain operations.
Once logged in, you will not need to enter email again. To switch account, restart application.
We first create an account.
-Enter an email.
-Enter a password.
Now select which type of account to create and fill in the info. Attendee account for attending events. Organizer account for organizing events.
Attendee Account -
    - We can now List our attending events.
    - We can purchase a ticket for our account
        - Enter the ticket number (Example: 103 or 104)
    - Now list our attending events again.

Organizer Account -
    - We can list our created events.
    - We can now create an event.
    - Now we can list our created events again.


Q5)

CREATE INDEX categories ON event(category, title) 
	This index is useful because often times queries involve looking up the events of a specific category as well as other events in the same category. 
	
CREATE INDEX eventSeats ON ticket(event_id, seat_id) CLUSTER
	This index is useful when tickets are being queried for. Because there are many tickets, it is useful to have them ordered first by the event and then by the seats.
	It is clustered on the event_id because queries and searches often involve looking at all the seats of an event and would make the query considerably more efficient if it was clustered.
	In addition, most of the tickets are created all at once depending on the venue and event which means there is generally not many inserts afterwards which would be more costly in a clustered index.
